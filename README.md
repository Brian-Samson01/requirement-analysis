# 🧩 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
Requirement analysis serves as the **foundation of software development**, ensuring that all project objectives, system needs, and stakeholder expectations are clearly defined before development begins.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand and apply the key principles of requirement analysis.
- Identify and document both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Visualize system interactions using diagrams created in **Draw.io** or similar tools.
- Establish **acceptance criteria** that align with business and user needs.

This repository will contain structured documentation, diagrams, and examples representing the real-world **requirement engineering process** for a **Booking Management System**.

🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is the first and most critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), as it establishes the foundation upon which the entire project is built.

During requirement analysis, the development team works closely with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to determine what the system should do and how it should perform. The main goal is to bridge the gap between a stakeholder’s ideas and a developer’s implementation plan.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Elicitation – Gathering requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions.

Analysis – Evaluating the gathered information to identify conflicts, ambiguities, or inconsistencies.

Specification – Clearly documenting the requirements in a structured format such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Validation – Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.

Management – Tracking and updating requirements as the project evolves.

🚀 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers.

Ensures project alignment with business goals and user needs.

Reduces development costs by identifying issues early before implementation.

Improves system quality through clear and testable requirements.

Guides design, testing, and maintenance activities effectively.

In short, requirement analysis serves as a blueprint for building successful software systems—ensuring that every stakeholder has a shared understanding of what the system should deliver.
