# 🧩 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
Requirement analysis serves as the **foundation of software development**, ensuring that all project objectives, system needs, and stakeholder expectations are clearly defined before development begins.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand and apply the key principles of requirement analysis.
- Identify and document both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Visualize system interactions using diagrams created in **Draw.io** or similar tools.
- Establish **acceptance criteria** that align with business and user needs.

This repository will contain structured documentation, diagrams, and examples representing the real-world **requirement engineering process** for a **Booking Management System**.

🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is the first and most critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), as it establishes the foundation upon which the entire project is built.

During requirement analysis, the development team works closely with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to determine what the system should do and how it should perform. The main goal is to bridge the gap between a stakeholder’s ideas and a developer’s implementation plan.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Elicitation – Gathering requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions.

Analysis – Evaluating the gathered information to identify conflicts, ambiguities, or inconsistencies.

Specification – Clearly documenting the requirements in a structured format such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Validation – Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.

Management – Tracking and updating requirements as the project evolves.

🚀 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers.

Ensures project alignment with business goals and user needs.

Reduces development costs by identifying issues early before implementation.

Improves system quality through clear and testable requirements.

Guides design, testing, and maintenance activities effectively.

In short, requirement analysis serves as a blueprint for building successful software systems—ensuring that every stakeholder has a shared understanding of what the system should deliver.


💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of any software development project. It serves as the foundation for design, development, and testing, ensuring that the final system meets user expectations and business goals. Without thorough requirement analysis, projects often face challenges like cost overruns, missed deadlines, and product failures.

Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

1. 🎯 Ensures Clear Understanding of Project Goals

Requirement analysis helps all stakeholders — clients, users, and developers — achieve a shared understanding of what needs to be built. It eliminates ambiguity by translating business needs into precise, actionable requirements. This clarity ensures that the development process stays aligned with user and business objectives.

2. 💰 Reduces Development Costs and Rework

By identifying requirements early, teams can detect and fix misunderstandings before coding begins, which is much cheaper and faster than fixing them later. Effective requirement analysis minimizes unnecessary rework, helping organizations save time, effort, and resources throughout the project lifecycle.

3. ⚙️ Improves System Quality and User Satisfaction

When requirements are well-defined, developers can design and build systems that perform as expected, leading to better reliability, usability, and performance. Accurate requirements also help testers create precise test cases, ensuring that the final product meets stakeholder expectations and delivers a high-quality user experience.


⚙️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure a clear, comprehensive, and validated understanding of what a system must achieve. Each activity plays a crucial role in shaping the foundation of the software development process.

Below are the five key activities in Requirement Analysis:

📝 1. Requirement Gathering

Involves collecting information from stakeholders, users, and other sources about what the system should do.

Uses methods such as interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observations, and reviewing existing documentation.

The main goal is to capture all possible requirements — both functional and non-functional — to guide system development.

💬 2. Requirement Elicitation

Focuses on drawing out requirements through interactive communication with stakeholders.

Helps uncover hidden, implicit, or conflicting needs that may not be obvious at first.

Techniques include brainstorming sessions, workshops, prototyping, and use case discussions to refine the requirements.

📄 3. Requirement Documentation

The gathered and elicited requirements are documented formally in clear and structured formats such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Ensures that all team members have a single source of truth for project expectations.

Documentation includes functional, non-functional, and system constraints.

🔍 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Involves examining, refining, and prioritizing requirements to ensure they are feasible, consistent, and unambiguous.

Modeling techniques like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to visualize system behavior and data interactions.

This step bridges the gap between user needs and technical implementation.

✅ 5. Requirement Validation

Ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are practical to implement.

Involves review sessions, inspections, walkthroughs, and prototyping to confirm understanding and agreement.

Validation helps detect and correct inconsistencies or missing requirements before development begins.

✅ Summary

These five activities collectively help ensure that software requirements are complete, correct, and aligned with user expectations — setting the foundation for a successful software development project.
