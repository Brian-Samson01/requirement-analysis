# ðŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
Requirement analysis serves as the **foundation of software development**, ensuring that all project objectives, system needs, and stakeholder expectations are clearly defined before development begins.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand and apply the key principles of requirement analysis.
- Identify and document both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Visualize system interactions using diagrams created in **Draw.io** or similar tools.
- Establish **acceptance criteria** that align with business and user needs.

This repository will contain structured documentation, diagrams, and examples representing the real-world **requirement engineering process** for a **Booking Management System**.
